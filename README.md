### Description

DropIT is a parcel delivery system designed for the transporting of goods.  The system employs small logistic companies as their transporters, or an individual works as an independent driver.  Drivers will generate quotes manually based on the customerâ€™s package dimensions and weight.  Customers will get notified of the status of their package and can choose to accept or reject the offer sent by the driver. The customer has access to real-time delivery tracking in the mobile app. The system is intended to aid customers with their daily errands such as sending in their laundry to be done and/or collected, or having a parcel sent to/delivered from their friend. DropIT's vision is to provide a helping community within the small town of Port Elizabeth by creating a platform that offers a helping hand to individuals, improve the opeations of small logistics companies and creating a friendly, safe space for driver/customer interaction.
